# Python Video Queue

Program for queueing and playing videos from list or from sources like YouTube BitChute, Rumble.... 

- Using [MyUtil](https://github.com/grdall/python-packages)
- Using [Python with pip and VS Code](https://github.com/grdall/shared-documentation/blob/main/python-pip-vscode.md)

## TODO

- play in what? default video browser for system? hidden subprocess for VLC which sets video to watched when video finishes or VLC closes would be nice
- queue videos from  list
- queue videos from channels on youtube since last check
- user-defined queues/playlists
- mp3/audio for playlist purposes, not so much sources
